# Home-Secure
Nowadays, to secure a home became a 
very important topic to discuss on because now many 
people used to keep all their valuable belonging inside 
the home so it is very important to develop a system 
that can secure our home in a cost-efficient manner so 
for that this project has develop a system that can 
secure our hose more efficiently. This project uses the 
method of computer vision to identify the face of the 
person so whenever a person come it will detect 
his/her face if its match with its data base then he/she 
will be allowed to enter into the house in case any 
unknown person come then by identifying his/her 
gesture the model can determine whether the person 
come unknowingly or he/she come to enter into house 
forcefully without the permission of house owner. So 
here in this project, model can successfully recognise
the faces that are present in its data base and open the 
lock to allow that person to enter into the house. This 
home security system also alerts the house owner by 
sending a Gmail notification if any unknown person is 
trying to enter into the house by identifying his/her 
gesture. This helps the user to keep his/her house 
secure from robbery
